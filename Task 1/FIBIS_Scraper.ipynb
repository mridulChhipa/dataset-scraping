    "## 2. Dataset Selection\n",
    "- Filter by record count\n",
    "- Select **10 unique datasets**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Record Extraction (for each dataset)\n",
    "- Request page 1\n",
    "- Parse HTML tables/divs\n",
    "- Extract headers and data rows\n",
    "- Check for pagination → request next page\n",
    "- Repeat until no more pages\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Category-Based Organization**: Folder structure mirrors FIBIS website hierarchy\n",
    "- **No Overwrites**: Datasets with same name but different categories are saved separately\n",
    "- **Unique Dataset IDs**: Each dataset tracked by ID to prevent duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "### Error Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Retry Logic**: 3 retries with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 15s)\n",
    "- **Timeout Handling**: 30-second timeout per request\n",
    "- **Rate Limiting**: 1.5 seconds between requests\n",
    "- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues with next dataset if one fails\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pagination Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detects \"Next\" links and page number links\n",
    "- Uses `start` parameter for page offsets\n",
    "- Stops when no more pages are detected\n",
    "- Safety limit of 1000 pages maximum"
